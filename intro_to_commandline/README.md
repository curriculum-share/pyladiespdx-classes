Two classes for introductory command-line work. 

The second class was the more successful one. 

The basic idea is: 
Commands are made up of two things: executables and options

Options are also called "switches", "command-line options" and the audience may know of other names. 

Once a student knows that *every* command seen follows this pattern, they can make lots of inferences about how future commands they encounter might work. 

Also show them '-h' or '--help' options. 

So, class took 'ls', 'cd', 'cat' and a few other common command-line tools. They also used 'git' to download a project repo containing a tool that connects to the Twitter API.

Next, I demonstrated piping and redirection.

Then we explored our own systems. For example: using *grep* and *find* to search for documents with the word 'the' in them inside of their home directories. This was a hugely popular exercise. 

Then we used the Twitter API tool to grep for interesting things in people's tweets. Audience proposed terms having to do with movies, so we searched for "inception" related tweets and then shouted out the best ones. 

We also demonstrated capturing output by redirecting to files. And then opening those files and adding to them later on.
